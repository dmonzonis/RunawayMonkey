/**
 * @brief Class responsible of holding, updating and drawing all the gameplay elements.
 *
 * World is where all the nodes in play reside. It is also the responsible of updating the
 * game logic and drawing all drawable objects to screen when issued by the Game class.
 * World holds nodes in a tree structure, by having a root WorldNode, which stands on the top
 * of all nodes, and all nodes added to play are appended to it as children or to
 * some previously appended nodes.
 * World updates its nodes starting by the root node, which recursively calls the
 * WorldNode::update method on its children.
 * World also keeps track of the command queue (see CommandQueue), and is the class
 * that pops the commands from the queue in its World::update method and sends them
 * to its root node, which then sends it to its children recursively.
 * World has a pointer to the player actor, which is assigned after it is created.
 * It also keeps track of the spawn points for enemies, and the types of enemies
 * these points will spawn.
 * The world is responsible for handling the logic, as well as the collisions, that
 * occur in the game.
 * World also holds the resource holders with all the necessary resources, which are
 * loaded in the World::loadResources() method.
