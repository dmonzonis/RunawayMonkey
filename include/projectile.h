/**
 * @brief Entity with a fixed lifetime that moves at constant velocity.
 *
 * Projectiles are entities that represent objects that are thrown or shot,
 * and once they are shot they move at constant speed and direction.
 * After a certain lifetime, projectiles are destroyed, since they can't travel
 * to infinity (a realistic projectile would lose speed and fall down after
 * a while).
 * Projectiles also deal damage to actors when they collide with them, the
 * amount of damage depents on the type of projectile.
 * When a projectile collides with something, it is destroyed.
