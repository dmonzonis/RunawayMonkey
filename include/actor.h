/**
 * @brief An Entity that is "alive" and interact with the world.
 *
 * Actor is a subclass of Entity for entities that are "alive". Actors have
 * health, and they get destroyed when their health reaches 0.
 * Actors have Category types depending on the internal Actor::Type, which
 * will determine which types of commands can be executed by them.
 * Some actors may also be able to shoot projectiles, so the class also has methods
 * for projectile shooting.
 *
 * @see Command Depending on its type, actors can execute commands targeted for them.
