/**
 * @brief A state separates different parts of the game with independent functionality.
 *
 * A state is a representation of each well-defined part of the game that has
 * independent functionality from the rest. Examples of states are the Title screen,
 * the Menu, or the Game state, which is where the action takes place.
 * States are managed by the StateManager class, which is nothing more than a state
 * machine, and thus states need to have a reference to that state machine, which is
 * passed in the constructor.
 * Each state has its own methods for input handling, updating its elements and
 * drawing itself to the screen. It communicates with the state manager by requesting
 * the addition or deletion of states from its stack.
 * The state class also holds the @ref Context class, which allows the states to share
 * resources to save memory.
 * @b Note that the State class is not meant to be used as is, but rather used to
 * implement new states as subclasses.
