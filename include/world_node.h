 * @brief A world node is anything that exists and should be updated in the world.
 *
 * A world node (or just node) is something that exists in the world, and is
 * updated and drawn (if it has something to be drawn) each frame. Since it inherits
 * from the sf::Transformable class, it has a position in the world and has methods to
 * change its scale, position or rotation. <br>
 * Nodes get attached to others in a tree structure. Each node has a pointer to its
 * parent node (@c nullptr if the node doesn't have a parent, i.e. it's a root node), and
 * can have several children attached to it using the WorldNode::attachChild method.
